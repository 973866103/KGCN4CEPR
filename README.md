# Introduction

This is a a geographical Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks method for Countryside Ecological Patterns Recommendation (KGCN4CEPR).

# Dataset

The dataset includes the countryside knowledge graph

# Requirements

The following environments is tested:

- `TensorFlow = 1.12.0` with `python >= 3.6`
- `Numpy=1.14.3`

# Train on Dataset

- Dataset needs to be preprocessed.

# Running the code

 ```
 $ python preprocess.py
 $ python main.py
  ```
